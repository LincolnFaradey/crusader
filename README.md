_Crusader is a project with an emphasis on console mode chatting_

The main goal is to give an opportunity to communicate with others not leaving
the pretty nice console environment. Screw those shiny cool messengers, 
we need just to write messages fast and in a really convenient way.

>The crusader uses Rust on the client side and Go on the backend. 

>Our goal is to use the power of both modern languages.
